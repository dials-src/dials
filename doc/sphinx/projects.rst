The DIALS toolkit is designed to allow extension and reuse. DIALS
software is being used in contexts beyond its original focus on
synchrotron X-ray macromolecular crystallography. Here we list some
examples of projects underway that are using DIALS in various ways.

=============================

The Ada Lovelace Centre is currently funding developments at the
Scientific Computing Department of STFC and at the ISIS Neutron and Muon
Source to adapt DIALS for the time-of-flight Laue instrument SXD.
