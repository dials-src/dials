``dials.find_spots``: Added new ``spotfinder.threshold=radial_profile``
threshold algorithm. This calculates an average background in 2Î¸ shells,
and identifies peak pixels at a user-controllable level above the
background. This simple method is particularly appropriate for cases
with strong rotationally-symmetric background, such as electron
diffraction images. An optional blurring function helps to suppress
noise peaks and to join split spots.
