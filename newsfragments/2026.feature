Colours in plots:  Some of our plots and figures were still using the Matplotlib colour map Jet.  Matplotlib moved some time ago to using `the perceptually uniform colour map Viridis <https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/prev_whats_new/dflt_style_changes.html#colormap>`_, which was designed to be relatively colourblind-friendly, as its default.  In this version of DIALS, we too have moved to use Viridis for our Plotly plots.  With thanks to `Ammaar Saeed (ammsa23) <https://github.com/ammsa23>`_ for this change.
