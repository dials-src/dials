``dials.image_viewer``: Add selector to choose between a new default "image" and traditional "lab" coordinate frames. "image" frame attempts to align the fast/slow axes of the detector panels to screen x and y coordinates, so overall detector rotations will mostly be invisible. "lab" frame is the previous projection, where rotated detectors will appear rotated.
``dials.export_bitmaps``: Gained this same ``projection=`` option.
