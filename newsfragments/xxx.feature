``dials.find_spots`` and ``dials.integrate`` now accept a parameter ``exclude_images_multiple=N``, which will be expanded to the appropriate ``exclude_images`` definition that excludes every Nth image from the data set. This is intended for the sitation where a scan of diffraction images is regularly interrupted by calibration images.
